# React + TypeScript + Vite Microfrontend Project
This project is a demonstration of a microfrontend architecture, allowing users to understand how multiple frontend applications can be integrated into a single coherent application.

# Overview
Microfrontend architecture involves breaking down a web application into smaller, more manageable pieces, each developed and deployed independently. These individual pieces, or microfrontends, can then be composed together to form a cohesive user experience.

# Technologies Used
Vite: Used as the build tool for this project.
React: Utilized to develop the remote microfrontend project.
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Fundamental technologies for building web applications.
